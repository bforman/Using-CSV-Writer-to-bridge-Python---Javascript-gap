# Using-CSV-Writer-to-bridge-Python---Javascript-gap
This inquiry report details how I used CSV to convert a matrix of rows of data, in the form of a list of lists in Python, into a text file holding all of the data individually as lists. The text file containing the scraped data obtained from the Python script can then be used by javascript to produce pinpoint markers on the google map.
